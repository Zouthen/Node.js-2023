    <h3>Like for example in the image above you can see i have 2 dependencies in this project i want to use</h3>
    
    <br>

    <h2>npm install express</h2>
    <h3>You write "npm install express" in the terminal after making an empty package.json. 
      This will then install express in the project, and add the dependencies in the package.json, and add the folder "node_modules" to the project</h3>
    <br>

    <h2>app.js</h2>

    <h3>app.js is the start file in a node.js project. This is where you setup express like shown above</h3>
