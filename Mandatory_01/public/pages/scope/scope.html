<h1>Scope</h1>

    <br>

    <h2>Global scope</h2>
      <h3>The global scope refers to the outermost scope in a program. When a variable or function is declared outside of any function or block of code, it becomes part of the global scope. Variables and functions in the global scope can be accessed from anywhere in the program, including within functions or other nested scopes.</h3>
    <br>

    <h2>Function scope</h2>
      <h3>Variables declared within a function are part of the function scope. They are only accessible from within that function. Variables declared within a function are not accessible from outside of the function, including from the global scope.</h3>

    <br>

    <h2>Block scope</h2>
      <h3>Block scope refers to the visibility and accessibility of variables within a block of code, such as those enclosed by curly braces {}. In JavaScript, variables declared with let and const have block scope, which means they are only accessible within the block in which they are defined.</h3>

    <br>

    <h2>let</h2>
      <h3>The let statement declares a block-scoped local variable, optionally initializing it to a value.</h3>
    <br>

    <h2>var</h2>
      <h3>The var statement declares a function-scoped or globally-scoped variable, optionally initializing it to a value.</h3>
    <br>

    <h2>const</h2>
      <h3>The const statement declares a block-scoped local variable, with its value being constant and read-only.</h3>
