<h1>Frontend</h1>

  <h2>Public folder</h2>
  <h3>In node you normally make a folder called "public" in the project, which is used to contain all of the Frontend
    files, for example HTML and CSS</h3>

  <br>

  <h2>Html sites and their corresponding css and js files</h2>
  <h3>Inside of the public folder, you typycally give the files name like there other corresponding files</h3>
  <h3>For example: home.html, home.css and home.js like shown below</h3>

  <h3>Fetch is used to get data from the backend, and then use it in the frontend</h3>
  <h3>Fetch is used like shown above, where you first write the url to the backend, and then you write the method, which
    is typycally GET."</h3>
  <h3>then you write ".then", which is used to get the response from the backend, and then you write ".json()", which is
    used to convert the response to json, and then you write ".then" again, which is used to get the data from the
    response, and then you
    write the code you want to use the data for.</h3>
  <h3>For example, like shown above it first grabs the desired html element and assign the text "name" from the response
    to it</h3>
  <h3>and then it grabs the another html element and assign the image from the response to it</h3>
